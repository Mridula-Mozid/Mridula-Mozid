Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  Iâ€™m Mridula. Iâ€™m an enthusiastic developer focused on blending technology and art to create fresh and meaningful works. With a strong foundation in Java development, content management, and freelance design, I bring a unique, multidisciplinary approach to every projectâ€”whether it's building user-friendly applications, designing impactful branding, or tutoring students in subjects Iâ€™m passionate about.

As a Content Management Coordinator with IEEE BUP WIE, I lead key initiatives that engage and inspire a team of 50+ members. My focus is on content and event management. Iâ€™m dedicated to bridging gender gaps in STEM, inspiring creativity, and pushing boundaries, particularly in engineering and technology.

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my skill set by learning Flutter for web app development and diving deeper into full-stack capabilities to enhance my technical expertise.

Beyond my work in tech, I am an avid reader, exploring a variety of genres (except horror!) and sharing reviews and creative content on lifestyle, books, and art through my Instagram handle @mrimoscope.

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on opportunities that bring creativity and technology together!
